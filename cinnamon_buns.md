Put everything in the bowl and mix for 9 minutes. Add a bit of flour as needed. Added 25g this time.

Place dough in greased bolw and let rise 1 hour. Roll and add filling. Slice into rolls and put in pan lined with parchment. Let rise another 30+ minutes, then bake.

Baked 350 for 19 minutes (10 uncovered, 7 covered, then 2 more). Was a bit underdone. May be because I only made 6 rolls and put them all in the pan together. May need to bake longer for this configuration.

Mix milk @ 105 degrees with yeast and sugar. Let sit 10 minutes. Add milk mixture to the other ingredients and mix about 10 minutes into dough ball. Shape into ball and place in greased bowl to rise for about an hour. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.

Notes: 
- Dough was very wet, so kneaded in some additional flour on the bench. Maybe skip the vanilla next time?
- Baked for 10 minutes then rotated and covered in foil. Removed from oven at 17 minutes. Was cooked the right amount. Maybe a minute less?
