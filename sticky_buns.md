240g milk
6g instant yeast
12g salt
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
75g honey
115g butter, melted
525g all-purpose flour

### Caramel Topping and filling
170g butter, melted, plus more for sides of the pan
220g brown sugar
115g honey
3g teaspoon ground cinnamon
4g teaspoon salt


    In a large bowl combine the flour, yeast and salt. Set aside.
    In a separate jug, mix together the milk, honey, butter. Pop in the microwave and gently heat for a few seconds until the mix is lukewarm and the butter is melting.
    Once the butter has melted quickly whisk in the eggs until combined. You want to make sure the mix isn’t hot otherwise the eggs will cook.
    Pour the wet into the dry and mix until it forms a dough and all the flour is mixed in. It only takes a minutes to mix the dough together.
    Cover with cling wrap and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough rises for a minimum of 4 hours. After the 4 hours you can place it in the fridge for up to 4 days.
    For the filling: Mix together melted butter, brown sugar, honey and cinnamon. Set aside.
    Using a 9-inch cake pan, with a spatula spread half the caramel mixture evenly over the bottom and all over the sides Scatter the pecans over the caramel mixture and set aside.
    Dust your work surface with flour. Roll out the dough to a 1/8 -inch thick rectangle (around 20 inches long). As you roll out the dough, make sure there is enough flour to prevent it from sticking to the work surface
    With the remaining caramel mixture evenly spread it over the rolled out dough leaving 1 inch around the edge of the dough without the filling.
    Starting with the long side, roll the dough into a log. Roll it over until its seam is underneath.
    Using a serrated knife, cut the log into 2 ½ inch rolls (around 8/9 pieces). Arrange the rolls over the pecans in the prepared pan, so that the swirled cut edge is facing upward.
    Cover the tin with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour. During this time they will rise up to meet the tin and becoming bubbly.
    Once proofed, place the rolls on a baking sheet covered with parchment, in case the caramel bubbles over.
    Preheat the oven to 350oF (180oC) and bake for roughly 40 minutes, or until golden brown and firm in the center.
    While still hot, run a thin spatula around the outer edge of the pan to release the caramel rolls, and invert immediately onto a serving dish. If you let them set too long they will stick to the pan and will be difficult to turn out. Enjoy warm!
