# Pizza - Beach Style

Note: The following steps are what works best for how I prepare this pizza. Different kitchens, ambient temperatures, etc, may require changes to the process.

Based on the recipe in post 2445 from mjnern: https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=9068.msg621282#msg621282

## Ingredients
* Bread flour 100%: 550g
* Water 62%: 341g
* Instant dry yeast 0.5%: 2.8g
* Salt 2%: 11g
* Butter (softened) 6%: 33g

Produces two dough balls that will make 14 inch pizzas.

### Sauce (makes enough for two pizzas): 
* 1 can of Don Peppino Pizza Sauce
* 1/3 can of water (using the sauce can)
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 1 tbsp garlic powder

### Cheese
Freshly shredded sharp cheddar, about 140g for 14 inch pizza

## Directions (stand mixer)


* Add warm water (100-105 degrees) and yeast with about half of the flour to the mixer bowl.
* Mix with paddle or dough hook briefly (about 30 seconds) on low speed to make a slurry.
* Let rest 2-5 minutes.
* Set mixer on low speed with dough hook.
* Add salt and remaining flour.
* Just before the mixture is fully hydrated, add softened butter.
* Continue mixing on low until dough forms into a ball (roughly 5 minutes). Use a silicone spatula while mixing to scrape the edges of the bowl and help the hook knead the dough.
* Remove dough from bowl and kneaded a few minutes. No additional flour should be needed. Dough should be sticky, but not so much that it is making your hands messy.
* Place in greased bowl to rise in warm location. I normally turn on my oven for about two minutes to get it just a bit warm and then turn it off and put in the dough.
* After 30-40 minutes, remove dough from the bowl and knead for about a minute.
* Divide dough into two equal weight balls.
* Place balls into containers or ziplock bags lightly coated in olive oil. Ensure the dough ball is also lightly coated in the oil. 
* Put dough in fridge if using within 3 days. 
  * Alternative: Place in freezer for longer storage and move from freezer to fridge 24 hours before prep time.


## Prep and baking
* Remove dough from fridge about one hour prior to stretching. This time will vary depending on room temperature. During colder months, it may need 1.5 hours, and during the warm months it may be 45 minutes.
* Set oven to 550 degrees. I currently use a 1/4 inch baking steel and let it heat up in the oven for about 45 minutes.
* After the dough has warmed up, stretch and place on the peel. Dress with sauce and cheese. Cheese first, then sauce.
* Bake for about 5 1/2 minutes. If the oven canâ€™t hit 550, it may be slightly more. This is also based on using a well heated 1/4 inch steel. If the bottom is baked properly but not the top, try raising the rack in the oven or try turning on the broiler for the last few minutes to help bake the top.
